      HTML is an acronym which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language is used for creating web pages and web applications. Let's see what is meant by Hypertext Markup Language, and Web page.

      <br/>
     <font color="black"> <u>Hyper Text:</u></font> HyperText simply means "Text within Text." A text has a link within it, is a hypertext. Whenever you click on a link which brings you to a new webpage, you have clicked on a hypertext. HyperText is a way to link two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other.
    
      <br/>
      <u><font color="black">Markup language:</font></u> A markup language is a computer language that is used to apply layout and formatting conventions to a text document. Markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic. It can turn text into images, tables, links, etc.
      <br/>
     <u><font color="black">Web Page:</font></u>  web page is a document which is commonly written in HTML and translated by a web browser. A web page can be identified by entering an URL. A Web page can be of the static or dynamic type. With the help of HTML only, we can create static web pages.<br/><br/>
     <h3><u> Features of HTML:</u></h3><br/>
     Considering it is one of the simplest languages to design and code a website, the language is not case-sensitive.<br/>
     Example: <html> and <HTML> are both acceptable.<br/>
     
     For purposes of keeping the language usable on any platform, and HTML is not specific to any one operating system like Android OS or the iOS; instead HTML can run on nearly all the OS.<br/>
     A Tree-structure is the basic aspect of HTML.  This allows a root HTML tag to continue as an element, while child elements which  are added at any point of the structure as head and the body tags.<br/>
     HTML tags shall carry display information that can be used in Firefox, Chrome or any type of browsers<br/>
     Very useful for adding images, and hyper images, videos as well as other web pages so as to render them user friendly.
