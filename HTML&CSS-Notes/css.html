        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
        <br/><br/> (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to HTML.<br/><br/>
        <h3><u> Features of CSS:</u></h3><br/>
CSS is critical for website design as it helps in separating the design from the content. This helps in better readability, flexibility in programming and accessibility.<br/>

<b> files are integrated in HTML documents thus:</b><br/>
Internal CSS – is used as a style tag within the head tag. The advantage of this is the ability to style three or four elements.<br/>
External CSS- is used to add external CSS file by using the <link>tag and will be positioned in the head tag of the HTML file.<br/>
Inline CSS – can be counted as a better method to use as it will define properties  for a single tag like style attribute within any tag.<br/>
One can use multiple selectors to access every element/group<br/>
Example: ID Selector(#),  universal selector (*).<br/>

Styling is defined as key value pairs, and is used to define the font-size for H1 in 24px, or default 32px.
